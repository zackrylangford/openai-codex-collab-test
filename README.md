# Codex Collaboration Sandbox

This repository is a playground for collaborating with the Codex agent. It now includes a simple Python **static site generator** located in `static-site-generator/`.

Run `generate.py` to convert Markdown content into a static HTML site that can be hosted on GitHub Pages or any static web host.
